title: My Challenges
---
Practice, practice, practice, and keep practicing...can be much more challenging that one would expect.  Not only practice, but keep practicing the same thing.  I believe there is a saying, "Practice one thing and do it well".  Or maybe I made that up, or at least skewed the original quote. Anyhow, after finishing my bachelors in Information Technology I began my journey in trying to really learn how to code.  Unfortunately, I could not figure what language would be the most beneficial for me to learn while in preparation of my job search. For a while it was Java, then it was python, and a few more languages, here and there.

As, I learned the basics of one language to another, I began to see and comprehend the similarities that span across all languages.  This made it much easier to get more familiar with different languages that I began to encounter. This is where I would say I began to encounter some of my main personal challenges with coding.

*Functions
*Implementing it all

The basics of functions was not where I was stumped.  In fact, it made so much sense to me that I expected to succeed in this area without much challenge.  However, when moving from simple functions to more complex functions, I began to hit more and more road blocks.  I learned to break the problem down in smaller steps; however, still felt like I had a mental block.  As time went one, I became more confident in my "function skills", and also became more aware of areas of needed practice.

Implementing it all really encompasses much of all the was described above, from the learning the ins and outs of the programming language, as well as my frustrating journey into the mental abyss associated with implementing the functions.

To battle these road blocks, I decided to take many different avenues.  This included starting on sites, such as Codecedemy and then moved to more structured learning with Treehouse.  After more self-learning that I felt had been successful, I decided I learn better with a formal structure, the pressure to keep going, and to be provided with a direction that will lead me to my next job.  This brought me on the path of pursuing continued learning through Bloc, which if interested in that journey, check out my blog post, My Experience with Bloc.
