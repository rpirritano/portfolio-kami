title: My Goals as a Front-End Developer
---


My goals have changed and will continue to be modified and updated as I go through the program. Initially, my main goal was to understand more about the front-end development process.  As I have proceeded through the Bloc program, those goals have shifted to focus more on my competency in the necessary skills to successfully become a software front-end engineer.

Building BocJams was probably the main starting point of this shift in my professional goals.  As I used vanilla JavaScript, I began to not only want to successfully create the code for the functionality of the feature.  As each checkpoint moved to the next, part of the goal now became to also understand where to place the code and how to refactor the code to make the application more efficient.

Next, I saw another shift in my goals as I refactored Blocjams and built BlocChat with Angular.  I really enjoyed working with the Angular framework and liked how the project was further broken down into the components that allowed for quicker development and easier maintenance of the code.  I now wanted to become more proficient with the Angular framework and added this to my main list of goals.

I may encounter other frameworks that I will enjoy using and may even prefer over Angular.  However, at this time, one of my main goals as a front-end developer is to become specialized in the Angular JavaScript framework.  At this point in my professional career, I really have not selected any part of front-end that I can consider myself having any degree of expertise in.  By the time I begin my job searching, I would like to be able to highlight my proficiency in Angular on my resume.
