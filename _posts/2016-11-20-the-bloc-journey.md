title: The Bloc Journey
---

The decision to start the Bloc program was not a decision that I rushed into, nor one that I did not thoroughly research before proceeding.  I first encountered Bloc after I graduated from my program at Colorado Technical University.  At that time, I felt I had plenty of knowledge, however, did not have the real life experience that I felt was essential in beginning my career in development.  As I searched for quick and fast programs, many bootcamps of different formats resulted from my Google searches.  At this point in my journey, I decided I did not want to go through a 4-6 month bootcamp since I felt that I would not benefit at this time with cramming a bunch of knowledge in such a short of a time.

After much frustration of the feeling that I did not move forward enough in my development skills, I decided to revisit the idea of a Bootcamp.  Although, I still was not too fond of the short time frame to learn so much.  Then I came across the Software Engineer program at Bloc, a year long program that had an apprenticeship component and the depth of content that I was searching for.

At the time of this blog, I am completing the front-end portion of the program, a mere 3 months into the program.  During the first part of the front-end portion there has been material that was primarily a review for me and there has been material that was either completely new or I had at least heard of before.  It has been a mixture of excitement, frustration, stress, motivation, and even times of doubtfulness, which I have been told is the normal reaction of most students going through the program.

I was looking forward to putting my knowledge to the test with the projects, first being BlocJams.  Implementing vanilla JavaScript and JQuery were a challenge at times with many of the "Ah ha!" moments.  Following the inital project, refactoring with Angular was the next task.  Challenging as it was using a new framework, I was excited to finally get my hand on an Angular project.  Building BlocChat with AngularJs helped to solidify my understanding of using the Angular framework and helped to build up my confidence when discussing different Angular terms with colleagues.

At this point in the program, I am very satisfied with the program and would do it all over again, if the decision presented itself.  I am excited to continue and see where the program will take me.  Even with the experienced gained so far, I do feel that it will be necessary to continue using my front-end skills to continue to solidify my developmental skills.  Which, will also be part of my contuing edication as I proceed through the next phases.  

> As I continue through the program, I will update the blog post with my successes, challenges, and even frustrations
