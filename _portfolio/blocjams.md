## Explanation

BlocJams is a basic digital music player that will allow users to play different songs with included functionality, such as song pausing, stopping, and volume adjustment.  The add will user a local song library for data access.

## Problem

The goal of this project was to jump into JavaScript and develop the interface and interactions for a user to interact with the application. It will be necessary to have the main page direct the user to a collection view, as well as a album view.  Within the album view, the user will have the options to play and pause songs, as well adjusting the volume.

## Solution

For this version of Bloc-Jams, it will be built with vanilla JavaSript and later refactored with JQuery.  To accomplish the task, I broke down the project into sub-tasks, each with their own plan with incremental steps to be completed before moving on to the next step.  The template for each page was laid down, from the home page, collection view, and album view.  Onnce the necessary Javascript was implemented, the application was refactored with JQuery.  

## Results

Upon completion of this project, BlocJams a fully functional music player with all the basic capabilities, such as play/pause, next/previous song, and accessing the slider of the song length and volume.  A player bar was implemented to apply this functionality, which interacted with the functionality of the album view page.

> **Learning Point -** Got a taste of implementing an external database with a taste of debugging any querying issues.  Also, this application allowed me to get practice using data binding and practice when and when not to utilize $scope throughout the project. 

## Conclusion

This project tested my JavaScript and JQuery skills and provided a personal assessment for areas of improvement, as well as my areas of strength.  Although JQuery helped to shorten the development involved, it was important for initially building the application via vanilla JavaScript to not only practice those skills, but to solidify the understanding how JavaScript and JQuery worked together.
